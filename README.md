# Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web application for visualizing sorting and searching algorithms with real-time animations and step-by-step execution control.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Watch algorithms execute step-by-step with smooth animations
- **Multiple Algorithm Categories**: 
  - Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
  - Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- **Playback Controls**: Play, pause, reset, and adjust animation speed
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, dark-themed interface with intuitive controls

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite (fast, modern development environment)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (utility-first CSS framework)
- **Routing**: React Router v6 (client-side navigation)
- **Language**: TypeScript (type-safe JavaScript)

## 🎯 Purpose

This project demonstrates:
- Modern React development practices with functional components and hooks
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Algorithm implementation and complexity analysis
- State management for complex UI interactions
- Responsive design principles with Tailwind CSS

## 🏃 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/algorithm-visualizer.git
cd algorithm-visualizer
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

## 📦 Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized build will be in the `dist/` folder.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

Building this project helped me develop skills in:
- Component-based architecture and reusable UI patterns
- Algorithm implementation and time/space complexity analysis
- State management with React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- TypeScript generics and type inference
- Performance optimization for smooth animations
- Modern development tooling (Vite, ESLint, TypeScript)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add more sorting algorithms (Heap Sort, Radix Sort)
- [ ] Implement graph algorithms (Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS)
- [ ] Add code visualization panel showing pseudocode
- [ ] Include complexity analysis for each algorithm
- [ ] Add user-customizable array generation
- [ ] Implement algorithm comparison mode
